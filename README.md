# RoomMuse

## Project Description

RoomMuse is a MERN stack web app that lets you discover and share eco-friendly furniture items. You can add your favorite furniture items, delete them, and browse other users' posts. You can also leave reviews for other users' furniture items, providing helpful feedback and recommendations to others in the community. RoomMuse's architecture is designed to be scalable, which means it can accommodate a growing number of users and furniture posts without compromising on performance.

## Getting Started

To fully utilize our RoomMuse app and view other users' furniture posts, you need to create an account by signing up. Once you are signed up, you can easily browse and add your favorite furniture items to your personal collection. By being a registered user, you can also leave reviews for other users' furniture items, providing valuable feedback to others in the community.

## Future Enhancements

One of the future enhancements I have planned for RoomMuse is to include a bookmark feature. This would allow users to save their favorite furniture posts from other users and see them in a separate page. It will be really convenient to have all my saved posts in one place, and it will make it easier for me to find them again. This feature will make the app more user-friendly and enjoyable to use, and I can't wait to see it implemented. Plus, I think it would be really cool if the app could personalize my furniture recommendations based on the posts I've bookmarked!
